# Image Resizer

The Image Resizer is a simple, yet powerful Python command-line tool that helps you to resize images efficiently. It's an ideal tool for quickly adjusting the dimensions of your images without needing a full-fledged image editing software.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need:

- Python installed on your machine
- Pillow Python library, which can be installed with `pip install pillow`

## How to Use

1. Save the script in a Python file named `image_resizer.py`.

2. Open a terminal/command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the script using the `cd` command.

4. Run the script with the command:

    ```
    python image_resizer.py
    ```

5. When prompted, enter the full path of the image file you want to resize.

6. Next, enter the path where the resized image will be saved.

7. Then, enter the width and height (in pixels) for the resized image.

8. The script will resize the image according to the provided dimensions and save it at the specified location.

## Extending the Project

This project can be extended in several ways to meet your specific needs or to practice your Python skills. For example:

- Add error handling to ensure the script doesn't crash if the input image file path is incorrect or if the specified dimensions are invalid.
- Extend the script to process all the images in a directory.
- Implement other image processing features, such as rotation, cropping, and changing the image format.
